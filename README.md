# FreeBlocker

This is a free chrome browser extension which redirects you to google whenever you are distracted in work and try to access a customizable set of websites (like facebook or twitter). You can also set a schedule of unblocked time to freely access the same websites during your breaks.
The same features are provided by [https://blocksite.co/](https://blocksite.co/) which costs $11 per month for premium! Let me know how I can improve the extension and feel free to join the effort to rid the world of distractive websites, one commit at a time :)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I'm working on uploading this to the Chrome Web store. In the meantime, you can download/clone the repository and add it to your Chrome by tapping `Load Unpacked` in `Extensions` and point to the downloaded directory.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Options

The extension can be configured by (left) clicking on the icon in Chrome extensions, or (preferred) by right clicking on the icon and selecting `Options`. Here's how to configure the options when on that page:

### Configure Websites

The default list of websites is shown. The extension will block any URL which includes these as _keyword matching_, so an otherwise productive website like `wikipedia.org/facebook` may also be blocked. To avoid such false positives, be precise with the keywords, e.g., `facebook.com` instead of `facebook`.

To add a new keyword, simply type it in the text box and click `Add` button below. To remove a keyword, select it in the list and then hit `Remove Selected` button.
Do not forget to hit `Save` in order for changes to reflect.

### Configure Times

The default unblock times are displayed at the very top. Customize them by `Add slot` to add another interval within which to allow distractor URLs, or `Remove` to remove the corresponding slot.
Do not forget to hit `Save` in order for changes to reflect.


## Troubleshooting

Reach out to me at [avijit.thawani@gmail.com](mailto:avijit.thawani@gmail.com) if facing any issues or if you have any feedback. As a simple hack for most issues, try turning it off and on again, i.e., reload the extension in your Chrome settings.
